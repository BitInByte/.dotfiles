# This is a demo config to show some of the most important commands more easily.
# This is meant to be changed and configured, as it is intentionally kept sparse.
# For a more advanced configuration example see my dotfiles:
# https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles

source "$HOME/.config/sketchybar/colors.sh" # Loads all defined colors

PLUGIN_DIR="$HOME/.config/sketchybar/plugins"
MODULES_DIR="$HOME/.config/sketchybar/modules"

FONT="BlexMono Nerd Font" # Needs to have Regular, Bold, Semibold, Heavy and Black variants
PADDINGS=5 # All paddings use this value (icon, label, background)
OFFSETS=4

##### Bar Appearance #####
# Configuring the general appearance of the bar, these are only some of the
# options available. For all options see:
# https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/bar
# If you are looking for other colors, see the color picker:
# https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/tricks#color-picker
source "$HOME/.config/sketchybar/core/appearance.sh"


##### Changing Defaults #####
# We now change some default values that are applied to all further items
# For a full list of all available item properties see:
# https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/items

source "$HOME/.config/sketchybar/core/defaults.sh"


##### Modules #####
# ##### Adding Left Items #####
# # We add some regular items to the left side of the bar
# # only the properties deviating from the current defaults need to be set
source "$MODULES_DIR/left.sh"
##### Adding Right Items #####
# In the same way as the left items we can add items to the right side.
# Additional position (e.g. center) are available, see:
# https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/items#adding-items-to-sketchybar
# Some items refresh on a fixed cycle, e.g. the clock runs its script once
# every 10s. Other items respond to events they subscribe to, e.g. the
# volume.sh script is only executed once an actual change in system audio
# volume is registered. More info about the event system can be found here:
# https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/events

source "$MODULES_DIR/right.sh"

##### Finalizing Setup #####
# The below command is only needed at the end of the initial configuration to
# force all scripts to run the first time, it should never be run in an item script.

sketchybar --update
